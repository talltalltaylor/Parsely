To run these files as a demo, you'll need to clone or download this folder from the repository,
then, once you have the files in a directory on your machine, open Google Chrome and navaigate
to chrome://extensions. Once there, be sure to enable Developer Mode in the top right-hand corner,
then select Load Unpacked, and select the folder/directory saved to your computer.
At this point the icon should appear, and the menu should be operational. The main functionality
has yet to be added. This is just a demo.
