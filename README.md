# Parsely
Chrome extension to parse out recipe cards from HTML cooking pages/food blogs.

# Getting Started

Parsely will soon be published in the Chrome store. If you want to try it out before then, clone the repo and
navigate to chrome://extensions, where you will 'Load Unpacked' and point it to the Demo folder.

# Usage

To use Parsely, click the green Parsely icon that appears in the browser after loading it into Chrome.
If you are looking at a recipe, click the parse icon in the menu to parse out the recipe card. 
Click it again to un-parse.

If you click the settings icon, you can select to open the card in a new tab with no added css.
Check that box, and click the parse icon. Close the tab when you're done. 
MAJOR DISCLAIMER: Results for this option will be highly varied. Sometimes it looks great. 
Sometimes it looks like death.
