# Parsely
Chrome extension to parse out recipe cards from HTML cooking pages/food blogs. Works with over 75 recipe websites currently.

# Getting Started

Parsely is currently in Beta testing! I plan on releasing it publicly on the chrome store on August 1st, 2019. If you don't want to wait, you can email parsely.suggestions@gmail.com for a link to the beta. 

# Usage

To use Parsely, click the green Parsely icon that appears in the browser after loading it into Chrome.
If you are looking at a recipe, click the parse icon in the menu to parse out the recipe card. 
Click it again to un-parse.

If you click the settings icon, you can select to open the card in a new tab with no added css.
Check that box, and click the parse icon. Close the tab when you're done. 
MAJOR DISCLAIMER: Results for this option will be highly varied. Sometimes it looks great. 
Sometimes it looks like death.
